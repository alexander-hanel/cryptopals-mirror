# Crypto Challenge Set 3

This is the next set of block cipher cryptography challenges (even the randomness stuff here plays into block cipher crypto).

This set is moderately difficult. It includes a famous attack against CBC mode, and a "cloning" attack on a popular RNG that can be annoying to get right.

We've also reached a point in the crypto challenges where all the challenges, with one possible exception, are valuable in breaking real-world crypto.

17. [The CBC padding oracle](challenges/challenge-17.md)
18. [Implement CTR, the stream cipher mode](challenges/challenge-18.md)
19. [Break fixed-nonce CTR mode using substitutions](challenges/challenge-19.md)
20. [Break fixed-nonce CTR statistically](challenges/challenge-20.md)
21. [Implement the MT19937 Mersenne Twister RNG](challenges/challenge-21.md)
22. [Crack an MT19937 seed](challenges/challenge-22.md)
23. [Clone an MT19937 RNG from its output](challenges/challenge-23.md)
24. [Create the MT19937 stream cipher and break it](challenges/challenge-24.md)
