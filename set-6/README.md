# Crypto Challenge Set 6

This is the __last of our original crypto challenges__.

This set exclusively covers __number-theoretic cryptography__, and, in particular, RSA and DSA.

This set is __hard__. The concepts are again new. The attacks involve some math --- but nothing you didn't learn in 9th grade --- and a significant amount of programming.

But __they're worth it__. Two of these attacks in particular are among the most valuable in real-world cryptography.

41. [Implement unpadded message recovery oracle](challenges/challenge-41.md)
42. [Bleichenbacher's e=3 RSA Attack](challenges/challenge-42.md)
43. [DSA key recovery from nonce](challenges/challenge-43.md)
44. [DSA nonce recovery from repeated nonce](challenges/challenge-44.md)
45. [DSA parameter tampering](challenges/challenge-45.md)
46. [RSA parity oracle](challenges/challenge-46.md)
47. [Bleichenbacher's PKCS 1.5 Padding Oracle (Simple Case)](challenges/challenge-47.md)
48. [Bleichenbacher's PKCS 1.5 Padding Oracle (Complete Case)](challenges/challenge-48.md)
