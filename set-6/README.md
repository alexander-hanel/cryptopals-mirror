# Crypto Challenge Set 6

This is the __last of our original crypto challenges__.

This set exclusively covers __number-theoretic cryptography__, and, in particular, RSA and DSA.

This set is __hard__. The concepts are again new. The attacks involve some math --- but nothing you didn't learn in 9th grade --- and a significant amount of programming.

But __they're worth it__. Two of these attacks in particular are among the most valuable in real-world cryptography.

41. Implement unpadded message recovery oracle
42. Bleichenbacher's e=3 RSA Attack
43. DSA key recovery from nonce
44. DSA nonce recovery from repeated nonce
45. DSA parameter tampering
46. RSA parity oracle
47. Bleichenbacher's PKCS 1.5 Padding Oracle (Simple Case)
48. Bleichenbacher's PKCS 1.5 Padding Oracle (Complete Case)
