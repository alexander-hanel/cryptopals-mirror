# Crypto Challenge Set 5

This is the first set of __number-theoretic cryptography__ challenges, and also our coverage of message authentication.

This set is __significantly harder__ than the last set. The concepts are new, the attacks bear no resemblance to those of the previous sets, and... math.

On the other hand, __our favorite cryptanalytic attack__ ever is in this set (you'll see it soon). We're happy with this set. Don't wimp out here. You're almost done!

33. Implement Diffie-Hellman
34. Implement a MITM key-fixing attack on Diffie-Hellman with parameter injection
35. Implement DH with negotiated groups, and break with malicious "g" parameters
36. Implement Secure Remote Password (SRP)
37. Break SRP with a zero key
38. Offline dictionary attack on simplified SRP
39. Implement RSA
40. Implement an E=3 RSA Broadcast attack
