# Crypto Challenge Set 5

This is the first set of __number-theoretic cryptography__ challenges, and also our coverage of message authentication.

This set is __significantly harder__ than the last set. The concepts are new, the attacks bear no resemblance to those of the previous sets, and... math.

On the other hand, __our favorite cryptanalytic attack__ ever is in this set (you'll see it soon). We're happy with this set. Don't wimp out here. You're almost done!

33. [Implement Diffie-Hellman](challenges/challenge-33.md)
34. [Implement a MITM key-fixing attack on Diffie-Hellman with parameter injection](challenges/challenge-34.md)
35. [Implement DH with negotiated groups, and break with malicious "g" parameters](challenges/challenge-35.md)
36. [Implement Secure Remote Password (SRP)](challenges/challenge-36.md)
37. [Break SRP with a zero key](challenges/challenge-37.md)
38. [Offline dictionary attack on simplified SRP](challenges/challenge-38.md)
39. [Implement RSA](challenges/challenge-39.md)
40. [Implement an E=3 RSA Broadcast attack](challenges/challenge-40.md)
