# Crypto Challenge Set 7

This is __the first of two sets we generated after the original 6__.

Unlike the last few sets, __this set is a hodge-podge__. It also includes some of the few challenges we have that probably aren't useful against real targets (they were fun enough to include anyways). On the other hand, we also include a challenge that models the CRIME attack on TLS.

This set is __hard__. There's a significant amount of programming, and Wang's attack in particular is as difficult as anything we've done.
